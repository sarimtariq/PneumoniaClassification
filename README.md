# PneumoniaClassification

In this project, I compared different Neural Network performances by training and testing models on Pneumonia data from x-ray imaging.\

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience using real image data readily available through Kaggle, as well as common Deep Learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

Four models were trained and tested. Two of them are pre-trained, and two are custom defined and built.

Pre-trained:
* VGG16 Pre-trained Model.ipynb
* GoogLeNet Pre-trained Model.ipynb

Custom Built:
* VGG16 Inspired.ipynb
* Resnet-18 Inspired Model.ipynb
